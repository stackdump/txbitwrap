refactoring to make better use of twisted reactor +
provide an python interface between eventstore and application code

BACKLOG
=======
* add long-poll to observe stream of a job in process
  * add task queue https://github.com/terrycojones/txrdq
  * to process events & serve as a means to enqueue new events

ICEBOX
======
* provide scheduling algorithms for controlling next triggered transaction/job/task
  * replace the default order by random() where state[] + delta[] => valid_state_vector
* eventually apply scheduling algos
  * simple weighting
  * or machine learning for comparing possible actions
* support self-signed SSL cert generation 
  * use ip address as CNAME
  * should install before or after container starts
