WIP
===
* Develop Meta-streams
  * try out models.xml to upload PNML
    * ? just append body to stream ?

* support users/roles
  * using roles.xml - this may become a user record

BACKLOG
=======
* build meta-models for
  * accounts (roles?)
  * billing

* allow front-end user to subscibe to 'follow up' event messages
  * users would subscribe using the event-id
  * these would be transient messages, not eventstream payloads
    * would this just be a normal 'bind' command ?
    * could write to bitwrap exchange w/ eventid as route key

ICEBOX
======
* support self-signed SSL cert generation
  * in docker container

* investigate how we could use tensor flow with bitwrap models
