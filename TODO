WIP
===

refactoring to make better use of twisted reactor + provide an python interface between eventstore and application code

BACKLOG
=======
* support self-signed SSL cert generation 
  * should install before or after container starts
* consider using https://github.com/terrycojones/txrdq
  * to process events & as a means to queue new events
  * can provide scheduling algorithms for controlling next triggered transaction/job/task
    * default order by random() where state[] + delta[] => valid_state_vector
  * eventually try to apply machine learning or simple weighting for comparing possible actions
