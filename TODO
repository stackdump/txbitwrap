===
* Develop Meta-streams

    * ? just append body to stream ?


BACKLOG
=======
* add slackbot demo for tic-tac-toe

* add a way to stop amqp client gracefully

* support users/roles
  * using roles.xml - this may become a user record

* build meta-models for
  * accounts (roles?)
  * billing

* allow front-end user to subscibe to 'follow up' event messages
  * users would subscribe using the event-id
  * these would be transient messages, not eventstream payloads
    * would this just be a normal 'bind' command ?
    * could write to bitwrap exchange w/ eventid as route key
