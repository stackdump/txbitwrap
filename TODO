WIP
===

Fix error when running simulator

BACKLOG
=======
* test websocket pub/sub 

* websockets are not cleaned up
  * perhaps should have loop to cleanup based on max age
  * when reset is called from UI unbind existing listeners

* update simulator to apply incoming WS events

* UI improvement
  * add link to Github repo in UI
  * add dropdown for selecting which schema to render 
  * add edit dialog for updating symbol attributes

* UI bugs
  * token ledger isn't reset when resetting a simulation
  * missing arc weight handle
    * ? use SVG marker element ?
    * should be txt/number positioned at midpoint in line as a clickable handle

* RPC call: ctx.load() - returns false (even though it works)

* add a way to stop amqp client gracefully

ICEBOX
======

* consider refactor
  * of machine module - all PNML code exists there now
  * refactor storage class

* add github authentication

* support self-signed SSL cert generation
  * in docker container

* make dual mode of operation w/ AMQP & txrdq more explicit
  * or refactor to get rid of txrdq

* allow petri-net json to be written back to disk over jsonrpc service
  * allow save to local storage in browser as PNML
  * support downloads as <pnml>.xml

* simulator(eventstore)
  * show formatted history in GUI somehow
  * provide replay, fwd back of event stream

* add a build step to compile python to js in ./docs
  * see also: https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/wiki/Writing-an-Android-application

* hyperledger/ethereum ?? smart contract generator/framework ??
