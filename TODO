WIP
===

* add github authentication
* issue JWT token after github authentication
* set cookie

# consider using github userid to create schemata
# some various options below

bitwrap=# \dn
     List of schemas
     Name        |  Owner   
-----------------+----------
 _$12345$foo     | bitwrap # prefix with _ wouldbe visually different from 'user' schemata  <-FAV
                 |
 foo_1234        | bitwrap # simplest but potentially error prone when querying schemata
 _1234$foo       | bitwrap
 _1234_foo$      | bitwrap
 v1$123456$foo   | bitwrap # schema versioning
 u123456$foo     | bitwrap # u meaning 'user'


BACKLOG
=======

* switch to timescaledb https://blog.timescale.com/tutorial-installing-timescaledb-on-aws-c8602b767a98


* update API's to enforce auth checking header in each API request

* investigate issuing tokens that expire after each state machine change
  * possibly require the current state version number
  * or previous eventid for each interaction

* fix issue where twisted failed to install from pypi
  * could this be a cache/pyenv issue?

* refactor - Improve postgres queries to build sql w/ params rather than string substitution
  ? should we actually profile the app with a python profiler ?

* registred websocket handlers are not cleaned up/unbound
  * when reset is called from UI, unbind existing listeners
  * tie this into auth + session managment

* add a way to stop amqp client gracefully when service shuts down

* UI improvement
  * add link to Github repo in UI
  * add dropdown for selecting which schema to render 
  * add edit dialog for updating symbol attributes
  * don't redraw entire SVG after every event
    * HACK added a 1 sec move delay in demo 'game' app

* UI bugs
  * token ledger isn't reset when resetting a simulation
  * missing arc weight handle to allow edit & +/- intial token balance
    * use SVG marker element - should be txt/number clickable handle

* APP gitwrap.com - features
  * allow registered users to log in via github
  * should allow users to create/replace schemata using definitions from github repos
  * should require authentication token to dispatch events
  * should provide ACL for each user's schemata

ICEBOX
======

* BUGS:
  * registred websocket handlers are not cleaned up/unbound
    * should expire server-side after some TTL

* support self-signed SSL cert generation
  * in docker container

* simulator(eventstore)
  * show formatted history in GUI somehow
  * provide replay, fwd back of event stream

* consider refactor
  * of machine module - all PNML code exists there now
  * refactor storage class

* make dual mode of operation w/ AMQP & txrdq more explicit
  * or refactor to get rid of txrdq

* allow petri-net json to be written back to disk over jsonrpc service
  * allow save to local storage in browser as PNML
  * support downloads as <pnml>.xml

* add a build step to compile python to js in ./docs
  * see also: https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/wiki/Writing-an-Android-application

* hyperledger/ethereum ?? smart contract generator/framework ??
